## 📅 Weekly Notes & Lessons Structure

All content is stored inside the `weeks/` directory.

Each week contains two parts (since I have 2 sessions per week).  
Inside each part I keep only the code that I work on during that session.


### Example structure


[Weeks/](./Bootcamp/Weeks/)

````text
Weeks/
├── Week-1/
│   ├── Tuesday/
│   │   └── Lesson-1/
│   │       ├── index.html
│   │       ├── style.css
│   │       └── script.js
│   │
│   └── Thursday/
│       └── Lesson-1/
│           ├── index.html
│           ├── style.css
│           └── script.js
│
├── Week-2/
│   ├── Tuesday/

This way everything stays:
✔️ clean  
✔️ organized  
✔️ easy to understand

## 🤖 AI & Tools I Am Using

Some of the platforms/tools we learn (or I use in practice):

- Cursor / VS Code + GitHub Copilot  
- OpenAI API (ChatGPT, DALL·E, Whisper)  
- Claude, Grok / Gemini  
- Lovable / Bolt  
- Hugging Face, Replicate, Poe, Playground AI  
- Low-Code & No-Code tools  
- TensorFlow.js (for AI in the browser)

The goal is to **learn how to combine classic development with AI**, so I can work faster and smarter.

## 📂 Projects

Inside the [`Projects/\`](./Bootcamp/Projects/) folder I will add details about main projects:

- Project description  
- Technologies used  
- What I learned while building it  
- What I would like to improve in the future

## 🚀 My Progress

This repository is **a work in progress**.  
Every time I finish a week or a module, I update:

- weekly notes  
- projects

If you are reading this and thinking about joining the bootcamp —  
maybe this repository will help you understand what to expect. 🙂
