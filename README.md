# HTML Project Deployment — Premium Bakery (HTML Only)

### 🌐 [**Live Website**](https://bleartdev.github.io/Bootcamp-PerProgramera/)

---

This branch (`deploy-html`) contains the **first deployed milestone** of my bootcamp project,
created after completing all **HTML sessions** of the  
**Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp + AI Integration**.

The project is a **homepage clone of the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} website**, implemented
using **pure HTML only**, without CSS or JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Project Assignment

The assignment, provided by the instructor, required:

- Cloning a real-world website homepage
- Using **HTML only**
- ❌ No CSS
- ❌ No JavaScript
- ❌ No frameworks or libraries
- Focus on **structure, layout, and HTML fundamentals**

The goal was **not pixel-perfect accuracy**, but to get as close as possible
to the original layout using only HTML capabilities.

---

## 🧱 Technical Constraints

This project intentionally uses:

- ✅ HTML5 only
- ❌ No CSS
- ❌ No JavaScript
- ❌ No frameworks
- ❌ No external styling libraries

Layout and positioning are achieved using:

- `<table>`-based layout
- HTML attributes such as `align`, `width`, `cellspacing`, `cellpadding`
- `bgcolor` for background color
- Inline HTML attributes where necessary
- Standard semantic elements (`head`, `body`, `meta`, `title`, etc.)

These techniques reflect **classic HTML layout methods** and are used
strictly for educational purposes.

## 🧩 Implemented Sections

Based on the current codebase, the following sections were implemented:

- Header navigation with logo and menu links
- Hero section with main banner image
- Welcome section with introductory text and call-to-action button
- Company history section with image and descriptive text
- Products section with categories and product cards
- Image gallery section
- Contact information section
- Footer with logo, address, and company description

All sections are structured using **pure HTML tables and elements**.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced and reinforced:

- Proper HTML document structure
- Use of meta tags and favicon links
- Building layouts without CSS
- Understanding how spacing and alignment work in HTML
- Translating a modern website design into HTML-only structure
- Attention to detail when cloning real-world websites
- Writing clean and readable HTML code

This project demonstrates **strong foundational knowledge of HTML**.

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Branch:** [`deploy-html`](https://github.com/bleartdev/Bootcamp-PerProgramera/tree/deploy-html)
- **Technology:** HTML5 (static)
- **Purpose:** First deployment milestone
- **Status:** ✅ Completed and deployed

This branch represents the **baseline version** of the project.
Future branches will progressively enhance the same project:

- `deploy-css` → visual styling and layout improvements  
- `deploy-javascript` → interactivity and dynamic behavior  
- `deploy-react` → component-based architecture  

---

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

This project **does not represent modern production best practices**.

It exists solely as:
- A learning exercise
- A demonstration of HTML fundamentals
- A starting point for progressive enhancement

The use of tables and HTML attributes is **intentional** and aligned
with the assignment requirements.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The [`deploy-html`](https://github.com/bleartdev/Bootcamp-PerProgramera/tree/deploy-html) branch marks the **completion of the HTML module**
and the **first deployed version** of the project.

It serves as a clear reference point for tracking the evolution of the
same project through CSS, JavaScript, and future technologies.
