    <h1>Pseudo Elements</h1>
    <p>
       They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know   <br>yourself better than those around you. Derick knew nothing about <br> this. He thought he had found peace but this was an illusion <br>as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that <br>he actually knew nothing about himself.
