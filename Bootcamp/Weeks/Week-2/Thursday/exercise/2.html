<h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
<p>
                Albert Einstein was one of the most famous and influential scientists of the 20th century. Born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, he is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, <strong>E = mc²</strong>, shows the relationship between mass and energy, revealing that mass can be converted into energy. His work revolutionized the field of physics and has had a profound impact on modern technology, such as nuclear energy and communication technologies. Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which helped to establish quantum theory. After a lifetime of groundbreaking research and significant influence, he passed away on April 18, 1955, leaving an enduring legacy for humanity.
